# fully-close-steam
Finally be able to fully close steam without anything running in the background
If you are not a python coder:
1. Go to the releases
2. Install steamcloser.zip
3. Right click on the file and press "Extract All" (it should be somewhere towards the top)
4. Press enter
5. Wait a second
6. Double click steamcloser then double click steam killer again and you should be able to run the file
7. If you get a weird menu popup saying windows protected your pc press more info then run anyway.
I'd guess it's because the program closes things.

if you are a python coder you can just copy the code from either steamclosergui.py or steamclosernogui.py
They are the exact same but one is started by pressing a button, the other is started by running the script.
